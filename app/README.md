#Insiten Coding Challenge
 
##Business Problem:

A company is looking to achieve inorganic growth through acquisitions. They have asked us to develop an online tool to track and analyze potential target companies.

###Challenge:

Develop a prototype that will allow the client to perform the following activities:

    •	View a list of targets
    •	Edit an existing target
    •	Create a new target
    •	Delete a target


###Assumptions:

    •	Use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular)
    •	Data does not need to be persisted (use mock data)
    •	Examples of data to be captured:
    •	Status (e.g., researching, pending approval, approved, declined)
    •	Company Info
    •	Key Contacts
    •	Financial Performance
